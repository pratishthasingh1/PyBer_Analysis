# PyBer Analysis

## An Overview
An analysis was performed to determine a relationship between different city types (rural, suburban and urban), the number of drivers in each city types and the fares. This analysis will address disparities among the city types. 


## Results
## Breakdown of rides, drivers and fares:
First difference we see in the summary dataframe below is that the more populated a city is (rural population < suburban population < urban population), the more rides were recorded. The total drivers and total fares also follow this trend. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver follows the opposite trend. They both decrease as you go towards a more populated city. 
An assumption can be made here that with more demand, the cost decreases.

## Graph of total fares per city type:
Below is a graph that shows the total fares for rural, suburban and urban city types. It is apparent at first glace, there are large differences between each city types. Urban cities being far more successful, while suburban and rural following behind.

## Recommendations
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Create a subscription option. Incentivize customers in smaller type of cities (not urban) to ride. Customers can pay $50 per month to have all rides that month would be $10 if they're going 10 miles or less from their current location. Anything over the 10 miles would be charged at half the rate. 
2. Right now, there seems to be a lot less drivers in rural and suburban cities than urban cities. To incentivize drivers, I would recommend seeing if the budget would allow a rewards system to be in place that will either allow drivers to get $100 bonus for referring a driver (after the new driver drives for the company for 3 months) or to allow drivers to get $100 bonus after 20 rides. 
3. To get more customers to sign on to the app, I would recommend a referral program for customers. Invite a friend, and both people receive the next ride free, up to $40 fare. If they both sign up for subscription services, then they both get next 5 rides free. If the invited friend signs up for subscription service upon enrolling, then they get 5 rides free.
